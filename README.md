springmvc-freemarker
====================

This is a demo project that uses Spring 4.3 with FreeMarker Template Engine and all the spring configuration files are written in Java.

Also, it uses Servlet 3.0, because of that, the web.xml was removed from the project and replace with an object that implements WebApplicationInitializer.
